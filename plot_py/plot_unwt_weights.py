"""
This program prepares the control plots of the Wt(alphaCP) distribution: 
the mean values of all the weights obtained by filtering the original weights with 
the unweighted events map (according to each of the alphaCP hypotheses).

Let us suppose the original weights calculated via the C0/C1/C2 coefficients are stored in
"data/weights_multiclass_51.npy" and the unweighted events weight values are in 
"data/unwt_multiclass_51.npy". If you want to store the plots in 
"plot_py/figures/unwt_weight_distribution_for_51_classes/" you can run the following command:

    $ python plots.py --input "data" --output "plot_py/figures" --format "png" 
    --option UNWEIGHTED-EVENTS-WEIGHTS --num_classes 51

Notice: "--show" option is also supported. Use it to show the plots as they are created. """
