"""  We quantify the DNN performance for classification problem in the context of physics 
relevant criteria. The first question is how well DNN is able to reproduce per-event shape of 
the spin weight wt_norm. We use L2 norm for that. The second criterium is the difference 
between most probable predicted class and most probable true class, denoted as ∆class.
This module implements the second criterium. """
