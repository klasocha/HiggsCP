# ρρ model 

This repository contains the refactorised (and in some cases corrected) version of the files related to the analysis of the ρρ event. So far, the modules responsible for downloading and preprocessing data, as well the process of building and training the configurable NN module have been added.

Changes include:
*   Comments and doc string function description;
*   Import sources (some of the libraries, such as urllib and TensorFlow, are now reached in a different way);
*   Upgrades to the Python 3 conventions and syntax.

All the files which are not relevant to ρρ events have been excluded from the repository.

Some of the files aiming not used anymore are stored in `archived/` folder.

# Roadmap
*   Adding the new version of the files responsible for drawing the diagrams based on the trained model predictions.
*   Rewriting the model to TensorFlow 2 (Keras).
